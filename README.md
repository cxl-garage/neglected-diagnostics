Genetic testing is routinely relied upon to detect illegal trafficking of wildlife, the introduction of invasive species and pathogens, and monitor disease spread or outbreaks that can devastate the health of our ecosystems and communities. But few commercial diagnostic developers, who focus on only a small number of human diseases, feel an incentive to address the huge need for new tests. This leads to a limited number of commercially available tests that are heavily restricted to centralized laboratories, resulting in the global challenge of neglected diagnostics.

SSEC is working with Conservation X Labs to build an easy-to-use platform that enables researchers to rapidly create genetic tests for every pest, pathogen, or species in the field. This new platform and corresponding tools will enable the community to better monitor and protect vulnerable ecosystems.
